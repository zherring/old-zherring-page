# A weekend to pivot

January 14th, 2014, one coworker and I were let in on a secret — the company formerly-known-as-Lijit-and-then-Federated-Media was selling the brand + conversational marketing platform and was rebranding itself over the weekend.
Marketing had been working with Angry Bovine studios secretly to develop the branding and messaging up till that point. It was up to me and two other teammates to make app-wide changes to the old platform, as well as develop a brand new one-page site announcing the sell and rebranding of Federated Media as sovrn Holdings Inc. Due to the sensitive nature of the changes, we had to do it quietly and ready for the Monday announcement.
Jay Farracane provided the PSDs for the branding and designs for the Desktop version. I designed the mobile version and coded both over a hush-hush, sleepless weekend

22 hours over a Saturday and Sunday, and about 10 French presses later, it was finished.
After the dust settled, the sell-off went through and I took a nap, it became apparent that there was a lot of work to do.
We were mid-project on a complete app redesign based on the old brand. Hundreds of hours in design, feedback, and research had to be completely rethought.


I decided the first step was the Weekly Stats Email.

We were using that to pilot some of the comparative analytics Aaron Martin, Chris Newman and I had designed out as well as to clean up a lot of the visual language that had become so fragmented over FM’s decade-long lifespan.

As the rest of the app is an on-going process and launching soon, I’ll save a full unveiling for September. Hopefully these snap-shots will be enough to give an idea of the direction we’ve been developing and refining since January.

Overall, the dramatic change was a huge boon to our process as what we were forced to rethink and redesign ended up being, in my opinion, so much better than our first run through.
