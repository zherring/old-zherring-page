<h2 id="hedoesthatalldaylongasaproductuxdesigner">He does that all day long as a Product &amp; UX Designer</h2>

<h3 id="hecanhardlybelievehowblessedheis">He can hardly believe how #blessed he is</h3>

<p>Zach specializes in creating flexible enterprise and pro-sumer software design solutions. He&#8217;s got a lot of practice at testing, organizing and implementing large-scale design pattern frameworks, and loves figuring out product-market fit. Designing an OS is on his bucket list.</p>

<p>He&#8217;ll hopefully eventually finish his portfolio.</p>

<p>Until then, check out his Medium for a short series of case studies, and Dribbble for a semi-steady stream of polished work.</p>
