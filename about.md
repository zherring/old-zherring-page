# Zach Herring Loves Solving Problems

## He does that all day long as a Product & UX Designer

### He can hardly believe how #blessed he is

Zach specializes in creating flexible enterprise and pro-sumer software design solutions. He's got a lot of practice at testing, organizing and implementing large-scale design pattern frameworks, and loves figuring out product-market fit. Designing an OS is on his bucket list.

He'll hopefully eventually finish his portfolio.

Until then, check out his Medium for a short series of case studies, and Dribbble for a semi-steady stream of polished work.
