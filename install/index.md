I had a half-day to spare and wanted to get some more experience in SVG animation. I'd played with it a bit at my last job, but that was focused on DOM manipulation mostly. This was more fun because the SVG's were embedded inline; because this was the case, I was able to play with the color and stroke-dash directly. Like I said, fun stuff.

*Best on Chrome, a little buggy on Safari at the moment.*
